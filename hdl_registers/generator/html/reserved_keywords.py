# Reserved keywords in the HTML programming language.
# HTML does not really have reserved keywords in the same way as the other generator languages.

# But we keep this file and dictionary anyway, to be consistent with the other generator languages.
# Perhaps in the future add JavaScript reserved keywords here, if we do more fancy thing in the
# generated HTML?
