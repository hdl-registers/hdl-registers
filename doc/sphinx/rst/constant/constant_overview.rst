Constant overview
=================

Using register constants is a convenient way to avoid duplication or hard-coding of
important values.
It makes it possible to programmatically provide values from the HDL project build flow to the
software that will integrate it.
Adding a constant to a register list will make it available in the generated code, e.g. in
:ref:`VHDL <generator_vhdl>` for HDL use, and in e.g. :ref:`C++ header <generator_cpp>` for
software use.

We support all conceivable types of constants.
See the menu sidebar for details about the different types and how to use them.

Adding a constant to a register list in Python is done by running
:meth:`.RegisterList.add_constant` on a :class:`.RegisterList` object.
Or in a TOML data file e.g. :ref:`like this <constant_integer_toml>`.
See the menubar to the left for an article about each constant type.
They contain more details about both Python API and TOML format.
